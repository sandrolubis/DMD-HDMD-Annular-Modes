# DMD_HDMD_Annular_Modes
This repository contains scripts/codes to calculate DMD and HDMD of the Annular Modes based on Matlab

1. dmd_u_erainterim.m includes the codes to calculate dynamic mode decomposition of the zonal mean zonal wind anomalies (p, lat) from ERA-Interim.

2. eof_u_erainterim.ncl includes the codes to calculate empirical orthogonal functions of the zonal mean zonal wind anomalies from ERA-Interim.

3. corr_dmd_u_erainterim.ncl includes the codes to find pairs of DMD modes that are highly correlated with the EOF modes.

4. dmd_u_erainterim_plot.ncl includes the codes to plot the best pairs of DMD modes.
